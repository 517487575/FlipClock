### New in v1.0

FlipClock originally was developed an example library for a computer science class that I taught. I never actually thought people would use it, let alone imagine how people would use it. It's been a long time coming, but FlipClock.js has been rewritten for a modern age with no dependencies.

- Rewritten ES6 Syntax
- No dependencies, pure vanilla JS
- Import with Webpack, Rollup, Browserify with the UMD build
- Mobile friendly with responsive CSS
- Supports negative values
- Supports alpha values
- All new CSS themes for different flip effects
- All new clock faces
- Extensible and customizable
